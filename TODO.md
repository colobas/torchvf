## TODO List:
 - Scripts to reproduce all experiments.
 - Setup new config system. 
 - Usage and documentation.
 - Contributions (Not accepting pulls ATM, but feel free to post issues or send me emails.)
 - Add image/diagram for vector field based methods.
 - Add support for computing Omnipose and centroid based vector fields. 
    - Omnipose won't be exact, they have custom EDT algorithm. 
    - Divergence and normalization too. 
 - demo.py for TorchVF API.
 - Make it so no modification to the BPCIS dataset is needed.
 - Clean and add additional notebooks.

## Long Term TODO:
 - PyTorch DBSCAN.
 - PyTorch EDT / SDF.
 - Generalize affinity derived vector field. 
 - Dormand Prince adaptive numeric integration solver.
